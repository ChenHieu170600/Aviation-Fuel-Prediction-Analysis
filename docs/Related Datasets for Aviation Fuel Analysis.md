## Related Datasets for Aviation Fuel Analysis

Here's a compilation of datasets I've encountered during my search that are related to aviation, weather, and fuel, along with a brief description of each. Please note that direct 'per-flight extra fuel' data is scarce in public domains.

### 1. US 2023 Civil Flights, delays, meteo and aircrafts (Kaggle)
*   **URL:** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bordanova/2023-us-civil-flights-delay-meteo-and-aircraft
*   **Description:** This dataset offers comprehensive information on US civil aviation flights in 2023. It includes departure and arrival delays, descriptions of delays, detailed weather data (rain, snow, pressure, temperature min/max/avg, wind speed and direction) for each airport, associated airlines, and aircraft information (manufacturer, model, age). While it has extensive flight and weather data, it *does not* contain direct fuel consumption figures.

### 2. Weather Observations in Aviation industry (Kaggle)
*   **URL:** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aadharshviswanath/flight-data
*   **Description:** This dataset provides flight details and associated weather conditions. It includes Flight ID, Date & Time, Departure & Arrival Airports, Temperature (Celsius), Wind Speed (knots), Turbulence Level (High, Medium, Low), and Visibility (km). Similar to the previous Kaggle dataset, it's rich in flight and weather data but lacks direct fuel consumption information.

### 3. FAA Performance Databases (Fuel Burn database mention)
*   **URL:** https://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/ato/service_units/systemops/perf_analysis/perf_data
*   **Description:** The FAA website mentions a 



'Fuel Burn database' which contains per-flight fuel consumption data for select city pairs. However, this data is provided voluntarily by airlines for congressional requirements and is *not publicly available for download* for general research purposes.

### 4. Certificated Air Carrier Fuel Consumption and Travel (Bureau of Transportation Statistics - BTS)
*   **URL:** https://www.bts.gov/content/certificated-air-carrier-fuel-consumption-and-travel
*   **Description:** This dataset provides aggregated fuel consumption and travel data for certificated air carriers. It includes information like total fuel consumed, but it is *not at the per-flight level* and does not directly link to specific weather conditions for individual flights. It's more for high-level statistical analysis.

### 5. OST_R | BTS (Historical Fuel Cost and Consumption)
*   **URL:** https://www.transtats.bts.gov/fuel.asp
*   **Description:** This page on the Bureau of Transportation Statistics website provides historical data on airline fuel cost and consumption, going back to 2000 (and even earlier for all-carrier summary). Similar to the previous BTS dataset, this is aggregated data and *not suitable for per-flight analysis* with detailed weather conditions.

### 6. Brazilian Aviation Fuel Data (mentioned in research paper)
*   **Description:** A research paper (from Travel Impact Model) indicated that the only public dataset with flight-level fuel burn data is from Brazil. However, direct searches for this specific dataset have only yielded aggregated fuel sales data or research papers discussing fuel consumption, *not a downloadable per-flight dataset* with associated weather.

**Summary:**

While there are datasets with flight information and separate weather data, and some aggregated fuel consumption data, a public dataset that combines *per-flight actual fuel consumption* with *detailed, corresponding weather conditions* (especially forecasts) for individual flights is extremely difficult to find. The Kaggle dataset "US 2023 Civil Flights, delays, meteo and aircrafts" (Option 1) is the most promising in terms of detailed flight and weather data, but it lacks the direct fuel consumption metric.
